BloonsTD style tower defence demo in JavaScript

- menu code is messy as it was pretty rushed in the end
- NodeJS and MongoDB code has been disabled because I needed it only as a proof of concept, and didnt want to actually keep track of any score on a server
- press K for infinite money
- classic BTD rules apply - lead bloons only take damage from explosions, black bloons don't take any from explosions etc.
